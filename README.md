# Knowledge Management & Digital Strategy in Global Organisations

## *Strategic research project inspired by global consulting and platform-led organisations (Accenture & Uber)*

# Overview

This project demonstrates how Knowledge Management (KM) and digital strategy together shape organisational efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage in large, complex organisations.

Using case studies of **Accenture** and **Uber**, I analysed how different organisational models—people-led consulting versus platform-led technology—design and leverage KM to support digital transformation and global scale.

Using:

* Strategic case study analysis
* Knowledge Management frameworks (SECI model)
* Business and industry frameworks (SWOT, PESTLE, Porter’s Five Forces)
* Publicly available organisational and industry research

The goal was to translate academic KM concepts into practical, business-relevant insights, showing how organisations can design KM systems that accelerate learning, enable digital strategy, and support decision-making at scale.

# Business Problem

As organisations scale digitally, they face recurring challenges:

* Knowledge trapped in silos despite advanced digital tools
* Difficulty converting individual expertise into organisational capability
* Slow learning cycles in fast-moving markets
* Weak linkage between KM initiatives and business outcomes

Key questions addressed:

* How do leading organisations design KM systems that actually scale?
* How does KM enable (or limit) digital transformation?
* What role do platforms, people, and culture play in knowledge flow?
* How can KM create sustained competitive advantage, not just documentation?

# Solution Approach

I conducted a structured strategic analysis using two contrasting organisational models.

**🔹 Case Study 1: Accenture — KM as a Digital Enabler**

* Analysed Accenture’s integrated KM and digital strategy
* Examined Communities of Practice, mentoring, and global knowledge repositories
* Studied digital platforms such as SynOps and AIP+ that enable reuse of expertise
* Applied SWOT and SECI models to evaluate knowledge creation and transfer

**🔹 Case Study 2: Uber — KM in a Platform-Driven Organisation**

* Analysed Uber’s codification-focused KM strategy
* Examined how procedures, data, and technology enable global scalability
* Studied digital platform expansion (Uber, UberEATS, UberFreight)
* Applied SECI, SWOT, PESTLE, Porter’s Five Forces, and stakeholder analysis

**🔹 Strategic Framework Application**

* SECI Model to assess knowledge creation and conversion
* SWOT to evaluate strategic positioning
* PESTLE and Porter’s Five Forces to understand external pressures
* Stakeholder analysis to assess knowledge flow across ecosystems

# Key Business Insights and Strategic Impact

## *(Translated for strategy, consulting, and digital leadership teams)*

* Strong KM systems accelerate digital transformation
  → Knowledge flow determines how fast organisations adopt new technologies

* Accenture’s people-led KM enabled rapid capability building
  → Tacit knowledge sharing supported innovation and service consistency

* Uber’s codification-first approach enabled global scalability
  → Standardised knowledge reduced operational friction across markets

* Digital platforms amplify KM impact—but don’t replace culture
  → Technology enables scale, but people enable learning

* Weak KM slows innovation even in digitally advanced firms
  → KM maturity is a strategic advantage, not a support function

# Strategic Recommendations

* Align KM initiatives directly with digital and business strategy
* Balance codified knowledge with people-to-people learning
* Use AI to improve knowledge discovery and personalisation
* Design KM systems for speed, not just storage
* Treat KM as a continuous organisational capability

# Tools and Technologies

* Strategic frameworks: SWOT, SECI, PESTLE, Porter’s Five Forces
* Case study and literature analysis
* Microsoft Word & PowerPoint
* Academic and industry research databases

# Why this Matters for Modern Organisations

* This project shows how KM can:

* Accelerate digital transformation

* Improve organisational learning speed

* Support scalable decision-making

* Create long-term competitive advantage

The same insights apply to:

* Consulting and professional services firms
* Platform-based and tech-driven companies
* Global organisations operating across markets
* Knowledge-intensive businesses

# 📌 Note

This project is based on secondary research, academic literature, and publicly available organisational information. Insights are framed for real-world strategic decision-making.
